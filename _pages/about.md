Hi! I am a Ph.D student at [Seoul National University](http://milab.snu.ac.kr/research.html). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Kyomin Jung](http://milab.snu.ac.kr/kjung/index.html). Previously, I received B.E. degrees from [KAIST](). I have also interned at NAVER AI LAB for controlled text generation, advised by [Hwaran Lee](https://hwaranlee.github.io/).

My belief is that future humans will reach universal knowledge through language-driven interaction. As a key step towards AI-centric future, my current research is focused on the design of neural Theory-of-Mind and Predictive-Mind models. I propose that these [Neural Mind Models]() will be pivotal in understanding and achieving the user's goals, fostering cooperation, strategizing effectively, and incorporating social-commonsense. This holistic approach, I believe, will lay the foundation for harmonious Human-AI Society.
