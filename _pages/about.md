Hi! I am a Ph.D student at [Seoul National University](http://milab.snu.ac.kr/research.html). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Kyomin Jung](http://milab.snu.ac.kr/kjung/index.html). Previously, I received B.E. degree from [KAIST](). I have also interned at NAVER AI LAB and NAVER Labs Europe for [controlled text generation]().

My Ph.D. research primarily focuses on ***Controlled Generation** from Large Language Models*. More specifically, how can we control generations that are 1) [guaranteed to strictly satisfy essential constraints (e.g. safety guarantee)](), 2) aligned with [personal preferences](), and 3) still [preserving pre-aligned general preferences]()? As a practical and impactful solution for challenges, I strongly believe that harmony **between training-time methods** and **inference-time methods** is essential. Although it looks deeply challenging, I am enjoying this journey and looking forward to the new insights it will bring. ðŸ˜Ž
